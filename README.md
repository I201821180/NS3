# NS3
Load balancing algorithm for dense wifi network.

Deep Reinforcement learning based Dense wifi network adaptive load balancing using NS3
Network is designed using NS3 when input parameters and settings are controlled from Machine learning algorithm

Dense WiFi Network in NS3 using Python.

User can pick any number of STAs and APs, and the performance can be tested with any machine learning algoirthm by controlling the input and output parameters
